LEAD GENERATOR - QUICK START GUIDE
===================================

INSTALLATION (First Time Only)
-------------------------------
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to this directory:
   cd /path/to/lead_generator

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   If you get errors, try:
   pip install --user -r requirements.txt


RUNNING THE APPLICATION
------------------------

OPTION 1: Quick Test (Recommended First)
   python test.py
   
   This runs basic checks (30 seconds)

OPTION 2: Single County Test
   python test.py --full
   
   This processes Frederick County only (~5 minutes)
   Review the output before running full version

OPTION 3: Limited Run (3 Counties)
   python lead_generator.py
   
   Default setting processes 3 counties (~15 minutes)
   Good for testing and verification

OPTION 4: Full Run (All Counties)
   1. Edit lead_generator.py
   2. Find line: generator.run(radius_miles=200, limit_counties=3)
   3. Change to: generator.run(radius_miles=200, limit_counties=None)
   4. Run: python lead_generator.py
   
   Processes ~27 counties (~2-3 hours)


CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

Edit config.py to change:
- Search radius (default: 200 miles)
- Request delay (default: 2 seconds)
- Departments to search for
- Number of results per category
- Output filename

Quick examples:

# Faster scraping (more aggressive)
REQUEST_DELAY = 1
MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS = 10

# More thorough scraping (slower)
REQUEST_DELAY = 3
MAX_DEPTH = 5
MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS = 10

# Process specific counties only
SPECIFIC_COUNTIES = ['Frederick County', 'Montgomery County']


OUTPUT FILES
------------

After running, you'll get:

1. lead_generator_results.xlsx
   - Main output with all findings
   - Organized by county and category
   
2. lead_generator.log
   - Detailed execution log
   - Check here if something fails
   
3. leads_intermediate_N.xlsx (every 5 counties)
   - Backup files in case of crashes
   - Can resume from these if needed


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "Module not found"
Solution: pip install -r requirements.txt

Problem: "Connection timeout" 
Solution: Edit config.py, increase PAGE_TIMEOUT to 30

Problem: "Too many requests" / Getting blocked
Solution: Edit config.py, increase REQUEST_DELAY to 3-5

Problem: No results found
Solution: Check internet connection, try at different time

Problem: Program crashes mid-run
Solution: Use intermediate files (leads_intermediate_N.xlsx)
          Resume from the last saved point


UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS
--------------------------

The Excel file has these columns:
- County: Geographic location
- Category: Type (Gov Dept, Retirement, Hospital, etc.)
- Entity Type: Specific type (e.g., "IT Training")
- Entity Name: Organization name
- Website: URL
- Emails: Extracted email addresses (semicolon separated)
- Contacts: Names with titles (semicolon separated)

Expected data quality:
✓ Websites: 80-90% accuracy
✓ Organization names: 70-80% accuracy
⚠ Emails: 30-50% hit rate (many use contact forms)
⚠ Named contacts: 20-40% hit rate (often protected)

You will need to manually verify/enhance:
- Email addresses
- Contact names and titles
- Phone numbers (not extracted)


NEXT STEPS AFTER SCRAPING
--------------------------

1. IMMEDIATE:
   - Open the Excel file
   - Sort by category
   - Check for obvious errors
   
2. VERIFICATION (High priority leads):
   - Visit websites directly
   - Call to confirm contacts
   - Use LinkedIn to find personnel
   
3. ENHANCEMENT:
   - Add phone numbers manually
   - Verify email addresses
   - Update job titles
   - Add notes column for outreach status

4. OUTREACH:
   - Create mail merge templates
   - Personalize by category
   - Track responses in CRM


PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
-------------------------

Time estimates (with default settings):
- 1 county: ~5 minutes
- 3 counties: ~15 minutes  
- 10 counties: ~50 minutes
- 27 counties: ~2.5 hours

Data yield per county (approximate):
- Government departments: 4-6 entities
- Retirement communities: 2-3 entities
- Hospitals: 2-3 entities
- Chambers of commerce: 1-2 entities

Email addresses per entity:
- 0-3 emails typically
- Government: 1-2 emails (often generic)
- Private sector: 2-3 emails (better rate)

Named contacts per entity:
- 0-2 names typically
- Varies greatly by website structure


IMPORTANT REMINDERS
-------------------

✓ This tool finds PUBLIC information only
✓ Always verify before using contacts
✓ Respect CAN-SPAM and GDPR regulations
✓ Be polite with scraping (use delays)
✓ Some sites will block automated access
✓ Manual enhancement will be necessary

Do NOT:
✗ Decrease REQUEST_DELAY below 1 second
✗ Run multiple instances simultaneously
✗ Use for spam or unsolicited bulk email
✗ Assume all data is accurate
✗ Contact people without verification


GETTING HELP
------------

1. Check lead_generator.log for errors
2. Review README.md for detailed info
3. Try test.py to diagnose issues
4. Adjust config.py settings
5. Consider manual research for critical leads


RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
--------------------

Day 1:
  ✓ Run test.py to verify setup
  ✓ Run test.py --full for single county
  ✓ Review output quality
  
Day 2:
  ✓ Run limited version (3 counties)
  ✓ Manually verify sample results
  ✓ Adjust config.py if needed
  
Day 3:
  ✓ Run full version (all counties)
  ✓ Let it run for 2-3 hours
  ✓ Review intermediate files periodically
  
Day 4:
  ✓ Review complete results
  ✓ Begin manual verification
  ✓ Enhance high-priority leads
  
Day 5+:
  ✓ Complete verification process
  ✓ Prepare outreach campaigns
  ✓ Track results


ADVANCED USAGE
--------------

Import as module for custom workflows:

    from lead_generator import LeadGenerator
    
    gen = LeadGenerator()
    gen.delay = 3  # Custom delay
    
    # Process specific counties
    counties = gen.get_counties_near_frederick(150)
    for county in counties[:5]:
        result = gen.process_county(county)
        # Custom processing here


SUPPORT
-------

No official support, but:
- Check the logs first
- Review README.md for details  
- Adjust config.py settings
- Consider professional tools for mission-critical needs

Good luck with your lead generation!
