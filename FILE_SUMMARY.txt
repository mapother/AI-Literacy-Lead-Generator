IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:
======================

This is NOT a magic bullet. Web scraping has inherent limitations:

⚠ Email Hit Rate: 30-50%
  Many organizations hide emails or use contact forms

⚠ Contact Names: 20-40%
  Personnel directories often require login

⚠ Accuracy: Varies
  All data should be manually verified

⚠ Time Required: 2-3 hours
  For full run of ~27 counties

⚠ Manual Enhancement Needed:
  Professional tools (LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Hunter.io) 
  or manual research will be required for comprehensive results


EXPECTED OUTPUT QUALITY:
=========================

High Quality (70-90% accuracy):
- County official websites
- Organization websites
- Basic contact information

Medium Quality (40-70% accuracy):
- General email addresses (info@, contact@)
- Organization names
- Department URLs

Low Quality (20-40% accuracy):
- Specific personnel emails
- Names with job titles
- Direct contact information


REALISTIC WORKFLOW:
===================

This tool provides the FOUNDATION:
1. Discover organizations automatically
2. Find official websites
3. Extract publicly visible contacts

YOU will need to add:
1. Specific personnel names (via LinkedIn)
2. Direct email addresses (via Hunter.io or calls)
3. Phone numbers (manually)
4. Verification of all data
